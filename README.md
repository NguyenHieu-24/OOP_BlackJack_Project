# BlackJack Game

Welcome to our Blackjack game project! This game is developed using the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) method in Java.

## Introduction

This project was designed based on the Object-Oriented Programming method in Java. It addresses several problems encountered with the common Procedural-Oriented Method:
- The code is clear, easy to understand, and concise.
- The project is a unified logic system with many related classes combined together.
- Each class has many methods that take on different behaviors of their own class.
- The ability to reuse resources.

The aim of this project is to create a simple game rooted in object-oriented principles. Our team opted to adapt the game "Blackjack" using this methodology. The game distinctly exhibits object-oriented characteristics, showcasing the interplay of classes and objects. In this game, players aim to reach a card total close to or exactly 21 to emerge victorious.

It's important to note that our game is a work in progress, and not all functions are currently available for demonstration. In addition to the previously outlined requirements, our intention in undertaking this project is to apply and reinforce the various techniques we've learned throughout the course. This includes hands-on experience working with classes and objects, and logically implementing problem-solving through Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) methods.

Despite acknowledging the potential risks and challenges associated with venturing beyond the confines of our university syllabus, we are motivated to challenge ourselves. This endeavor serves as an opportunity to familiarize ourselves with the real-world pressures we may encounter in future workplaces. In essence, our ultimate goal is to progress further along our path towards becoming proficient and advanced software developers.

## Gameplay Overview

### Goal
Aim to have a hand value close to 21 without going over.

### Card Values
- Number cards are face value.
- Face cards (J, Q, K) are 10 points.
- Aces can be 1 or 11 points.

### The Deal
- Players get two cards.
- Dealer has face-down cards.

### Turn
- "Hit" for more cards or "stand" to keep the current hand.
- Continue until the player stands or busts (exceeds 21).

### Winning & Losing
- Win if closer to 21 than the dealer without busting.
- Bust if the hand exceeds 21.
- Dealer bust means the player wins.
- A tie returns the bet.

## Features

- **Login:** Secure login system for players.
- **Display:** User-friendly interface for gameplay.
- **Play Game:** Comprehensive game logic for Blackjack.
